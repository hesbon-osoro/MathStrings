        <p>
          The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
          <strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There,
          he studied under another giant of mathematics,
          <strong>Jean Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of
          physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler
          was the most prolific mathematician of all time,publishing over
          <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His influence was felt in
          physics and astronomy as well.He is perhaps best known for his
          research into mathematical analysis. Euler's work,
          <cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748) </cite>, remained a
          standard textbook in the field for well over a century. For the
          princess of Anhalt-Dessau, he wrote
          <cite> Lettres &agrave une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772) </cite>,
          giving a clear non-technical outline of the main physical theories of
          the time.One can hardly write a mathematical equation without copying
          Euler. Notations still in use today, such as <var> e </var> and
          <var> &pi; </var>, were introduced in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler
          died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly
          unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.

        <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>
        <p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>
        <code>
          <em>cos</em>(<em>x</em>)+<em>i</em>sin(<em>x</em>)=<em
            >e<sup>xi</sup></em
          >
        </code>
        <p>
          which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis,
          and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the
          identity:
        </p>
        <code>
          <em>e</em><sup>&pi;<em>i</em></sup
          >+1=<em>0</em>
        </code>
        <p>
          which relates the fundamental constants: 0, 1, <var>&pi;</var>,
          <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and elegant
          statement. A poll of readers conducted by
          <cite>The Mathematical Intelligencer</cite> magazine named Euler's
          Identity as the most beautiful theorem in the history of mathematics.
